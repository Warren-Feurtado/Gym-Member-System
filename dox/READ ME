PLEASE NOTE:

The link to Admin LogIn Page is located in the red Diamond shape,
 in the center of the User Login Page.

 "/Admin" may also take you straight to the admin page.

 Adding or deleting a membership Package in the Admin Dashboard will also affect the View on The Membership Page.

 Depending on What Membership a Logged In MEMBER has, the "Active" button appears on the respective Membership Card and is deactivated, instead of an active "sign up" button.

 Each New Memeber is AUTOMATICALLY assigned the Standard Membership upon SUccessful Membership Registration.

 If no user is logged in, all Membership Cards display a "Sign Up" button.
